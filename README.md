# My Personal Portfolio Site

## About

This TypeScript site, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) serves as a platform for showcasing a selection of projects I have undertaken throughout my web development journey.

You can access the live version of this project by clicking [here](https://lucagaravello.com).

To simplify the storage of project and skill icons/images, this site utilizes [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) as its backend.

## Sections
Upon visiting the site, you will encounter the landing page featuring an animated canvas background.

Scrolling down once reveals my portfolio section, showcasing a selection of projects I have worked on during my web development journey.

Continuing to scroll down, you will come across the skills section, which highlights the majority of my technical skills related to web development.

Another scroll down brings you to the about section, where you can find some information about me.

Lastly, scrolling down one final time presents the contact section, enabling you to directly send me an email through the site. Additionally, you can find my LinkedIn and GitHub links in the footer.

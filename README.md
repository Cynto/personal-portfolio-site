# My Personal Portfolio Site

## About

This TypeScript [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site was created in order for me to display a few of the different
projects I've worked on since I started learning how to develop websites.

You can find the live version of this project [here](https://lucagaravello.com).

This site uses [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) as its backend, to easily store project and skill icons/images.

## Sections
Upon visiting the site, you will encounter the landing page featuring an animated canvas background.

Scrolling down once reveals my portfolio section, showcasing a selection of projects I have worked on during my web development journey.

Continuing to scroll down, you will come across the skills section, which highlights the majority of my technical skills related to web development.

Another scroll down brings you to the about section, where you can find some information about me.

Lastly, scrolling down one final time presents the contact section, enabling you to directly send me an email through the site. Additionally, you can find my LinkedIn and GitHub links in the footer.
